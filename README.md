# TBank — Capacitor Android App (Ready to Build)

This project wraps the TBank mobile app as a **native Android application** using Capacitor.

## What's inside
- `dist/` — production web assets (index.html, service worker, manifest, icons)
- `capacitor.config.ts` — Capacitor config
- `package.json` — scripts & Capacitor deps

## Build steps (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1) Install Node.js 18+ and Android Studio with **Android SDK + Platform Tools**.
2) In this folder, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run android:add
npm run sync
npm run open:android
```
3) Android Studio will open. Choose **Build > Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
4) The unsigned debug APK will be generated (e.g., `app-debug.apk`). Install it on your phone to test.

### Notes
- The app runs fully offline after first launch (service worker caching).
- All data is stored locally on-device (localStorage). No real banking connections.
- You can change app id/name in `capacitor.config.ts`.
- For release build & Play Store, create a keystore and sign via Android Studio ("Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK")."# bank-test"
